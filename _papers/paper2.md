abstract_en: "Although there have been many researches on the disease information system with the increased interest in disease, the existing systems have limitations in terms of emerging disease monitoring and internationalization. The purpose of this study is to develop a worldwide emerging disease-related information extraction system from news data, which provides nation-specific disease related information, disease-related topic ranking, mapbased number of news articles per region, and various charts showing top disease regions and diseases. Our system is available on the web through http://www.epidemic.co.kr/worldwide."
